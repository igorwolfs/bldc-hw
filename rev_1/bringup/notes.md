# Issue
At a voltage above 10 volts
- The MC34063 chip doesn't stabilize the voltage to the required number (it stays around 8.5 V)
- The current oscillates between its minimal and maximally set value.
- The voltage stays below 10 volts due to the current limitation.

## Check 1
Check the output of the MC34063A at 10 Volts
- It seems unlikely that all the current goes there, since there's a thermal fuse there which limits the current.

### Observation
The value here seems to simply not increase. It stays around 8-9 volts.

## Check 2
Check the output voltage at 3.3 and 5 V
- Also seems unlikely the current is high there since there's also a thermal fuse present

### Observation
The 3.3 and 5 V outputs are stable

## Check 3
Check the voltage waveform at VBAT

### Observation
- Same waveform as for the 10 V supply

# Observations
- CAN RX is 5 volts (is it supposed to be?)
- 3.3 V is stable, 5 V is stable
- The Phase voltages oscillate depending on the switching, but their average ALWAYS stays between 3-5 volts
    - The voltage here goes up together with the supply.
    - The phase voltage is 1 V at 6 V
    - The phase voltage is 2 V at 7.1 V

## Why is the phase-voltage nonzero?
- They are connected together through the virtual ground.
- There is a factor 1 / 3 x the phase voltage which the virtual ground is supposed to be at.
- They are connected to the OPAMP input through the current resistor.
- The voltage only starts going up from the moment the CPU is supplied with power.
- There's likely curent leaking away through the mosfet switches
    - This can be observed through the sudden voltage spikes over the shunt 0.003 ohm resistor to about 4 volts

### N-channel FET observations
- Datasheet: For conduction: Vgs >= Vth + Vds is a requirement for conduction with Vth: 2-4 volts.

    - Pin order (gate -> drain -> source)

- VBAT = 5 V
    - Vg: 1.9 V (5 V VBAT)
    - Vd: 5 V
    - Vs: 0.1 V
- VBAT = 7 V
    - Vg: 3.2 V
    - Vd: 7 V
    - Vs: 1.9 V
- VBAT = 9 V
    - Vg: 4.9 V
    - Vd: 9 V 
    - Vs: 3.7
- VBAT = 11 V (current limited to 1 amp)
    - Vg: jumps up and down around 5 V
    - Vd: 11 V
    - Vs: jumps between 5 and 11 volts

Main questions here
- How can it be that the source-voltage is nonzero from the start?
    - I probably should have pulled down the FET driving voltage
- Why do the problems start occuring from the moment the FET drivers get enough voltage to start operating?
    - There seem to be no shorts to ground possible, given the output state of the FET driver is 0 at all times
    - However this does contradict current spikes visible in the shunt resistor to ground.
        - There are peaks of 3.3 V visible here.
    - Voltage at the gate also does show spikes as high as 10 volts
    - Voltage after and before the gate resistor on the driver side show the same spikes
    - So the issue here is probably a connection straight through ground.

#### Try pulling the NSD pin low at all times, check if this issue still happens.
- Current consumption stays below 0.1 Amp
- Buck converter supplies steady 12 V to 

## Try buck converter switching 
- Wait 3 seconds
- Switch phase 1 HIGH
- Wait 3 seconds
- Switch phase 2 HIGH
- Wait 3 seconds
- Switch phase 3 HIGH
- Wait 3 seconds
- Switch phase 1 LOW
- Wait 3 seconds
- Switch phase 2 LOW
- Wait 3 seconds
- Switch phase 3 LOW

One phase of the buck converter each 3 seconds, with 3 seconds in between the switches to make sure the voltage has time to stabilize.

- Check on which up/down there's a voltage drop
    - FET to ground closed?
    - FET to vbat closed?

### Observation
It seems like 3 out of the 6 switches (either connection to ground or connection to VBAT), there is a voltage drop due to current limitation.

The gate on the high side stays high (around 15 V) for too long, it should probably be grounded.

# Issue found
There seems to be an issue with the way the FET drivers were wired (ir2104).

The half-bridge driver pin connection diagram wasn't followed. Vs wasn't connected to the Vphase (Load).

Because of this the load voltage and Vs were both floating.

And thus the bootstrap circuit increased the voltage with respect to a reference which wasn't Vphase which led to weird on/off behaviour of the FET.

## Solution
Soldering small wires from the Vs pad to the load to make sure the bootstrap circuit has the correct reference voltage.

### Issue
This doesn't explain the sudden current consumption on switching. This seems to be caused by a short circuit somewhere on switching.

**Next step**
Try figuring out when the issue in fact happens 
- When only ground FET is connected
- When Vcc-FET is connected

So try simply connecting to grounding one of the phases for a longer period of time and check the current consumption.

-> This capacitor discharge might actually be the reason, current should be lower when there is a connect of one phase to ground.

Guess is that the ground FET opens which leaks remaining charge from the capacitor at voltage Vphase = Vcc to the ground FET which leads to a sudden current surge (V * C), and discharges the capacitor.

## Observation
- When connecting the phase to ground, there is a large amount of current required (larger than through the capacitor discharge alone) which leads to a voltage drop due to current limitation on the power supply.

### Measuring impedance between the boards where wires were soldered between driver VS and load.
- There is a near short-circuit between the phases.
- There is a near short-circuit between the battery supply and the phases.
- There is a .5 kOhm impedance between the phases and GND.


### Measuring impedance on non-modified board.
- There is a 160 kOhm impedance between the phases
- There is a similar impedance between the battery supply and the phases
- There is a 87 kOhm impedance between the phases and ground.

### Conclusion
It seems that during modification, a short to VBAT was introduced.
Before proceeding with a different BLDC-motor driver, detect where the short occurred exactly using a (borrowed) thermal camera / really precise multimeter.

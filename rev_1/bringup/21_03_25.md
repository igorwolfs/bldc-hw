# Bringup Continuation
## Current state
- Bought some BLDC motors
- Connected the wires to the phase outputs on the BLDC.
- Flashed the single_timer_interrupt firmware onto the BLDC driver ()
## Tests
### Test 1: Disconnect the BLDC
Waveforms seem ok, no short-circuits.

### Test 2: Connect the BLDC
BLDC moves, shaky behaviour due to lack of feedback.

## Writing control firmware

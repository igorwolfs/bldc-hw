# ADC Debugging
- It seems like the ADC needs quite a long time to sample the value.
- Probably because the input impedance of the measuring circuit is too large, which results in slow charging of the adc equivalent input capacitance.
- So results for now seem ok, however make sure to improve on this for future versions.
